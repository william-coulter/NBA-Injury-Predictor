This script scrapes the website www.prosportstransactions.com for NBA missed 
game data and builds a data frame using that data. Each row in the data frame
corresponds to a missed game "event" for a player. The columns are:
date (of event), player's team, name of player inactivated,
name of player reactivated, additional notes. This data frame is then saved as
a .csv file for later use.
