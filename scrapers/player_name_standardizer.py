""" This function standardizes player name spelling. The spelling of player 
names in the 'aliases_df' dataframes may not match those
found in the 'names_with_stats_series' pandas series. The 'aliases_df'
contain up to three different spellings for each player's name 
(columns 'Player', 'Name_alt_1', Name_alt_2'). This function finds which of these
three names matches the player name in the 'names_with_stats_series'. 

Input: aliases_df; names_with_stats_series

Output: a dictionary for standardizing spelling. Keys are player names found
in 'Player' column in 'aliases_df'. Value is corresponding spelling of 
player name in 'names_with_stats_series'. If no match is found, 'No Match'
is the value.
